This is a map design for robotics training, students can use this map to experiment lots of task, like PID line follow, object scanning with RGB HSV, trun and line counting, sumo robotics.
## Size
The training map is same size as the WRO and FLL maps.
 - The dimensions of a map are 2362 mm x 1143 mm. 
 - The game mat must be printed with a matt finish/overlay (without reflecting colors!).

## Disclaimer
The map design by our members, and take [ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º Robitware (Pavel Tomshin)](http://elearning.robitware.ru/) and [ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¾ TESSLAB Robotics](https://www.tesslabrobotics.com/) map as reference.
